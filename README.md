# The Cipher Project

Welcome to the Cipher project! This project is a spigot plugin that aims to add as many unique contributers as possible by
only allowed each contributer to commit 35 lines of code in they're lifetime.

There is no end goal or goal for this plugin, add what you want! We want to see what the Spigot community is able to create by
working together with special limitations to the project. Will this turn out to be a Skyblock plugin? A factions plugin? Who knows! Fork this project 
and create a PR to add to the story of the Cipher Project!
